Issue : Gfortran, when using OpenACC, isn't able to have module variables viewable within a subroutine that is executing within an OpenACC Parallel region.  In this example, the 'testMod' module has an array 'test_array', and gfortan (as of version 11.2.0) is not able to execute the 'zero_array' subroutine in a parallel region unless 'test_array' is passed in as a parameter.  Interestingly, after 'zero_array' is called with 'test_array' as a parameter, subsequent subroutine calls within the OpenACC parallel region do not need 'test_arraay' as a parameter.

The error "libgomp: cuStreamSynchronize error: an illegal memory access was encountered" is displayed when a gfortran-compiled test code tries to run with "set_array" without a parameter.
